Key points:
============================================================
This website contains dashboard for admin and login for user page, so that that user can login. Admin dashboard can add, delete, view, edit the details of the members.This dashboard is really responsive (for example duplicate id cannot be entered and such stuff). It is designed using Bootstrap to provide responsiveness for tablets and  mobile phones as well. If admin deletes some user, that user when refreshed the page will be logged out and redirected to index page within 5 seconds.

Login details for both admin and member can be found on the home page itself.
